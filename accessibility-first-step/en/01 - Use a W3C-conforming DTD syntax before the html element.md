# Use a W3C-conforming DTD syntax before the html element

## Purpose

Allow user agents to correctly interpret the document.

## Technical solution

Place a W3C-conforming DTD as first element of the document. Chose one from this list: http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html

## Control method

Check that the first element in pages is a conform DTD declaration.
