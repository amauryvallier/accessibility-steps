# When you provide a li element, do not leave it empty

## Purpose

Allow the restitution of the right number of elements in a list. Avoid the use of elements for presentation purposes.

## Technical solution

Delete all `<li>` tags who don't actually have content.
Use `margin` and `padding` style sheets properties to control spaces between differents elements.

## Control method

Inspect the source code to check that no empty `<li>` tag is present.
