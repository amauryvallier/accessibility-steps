# Use a dt element as the first child of a dl element

## Purpose

Allow the output of the nature of content (here a definition list) for users that don't perceive the original layout.
Avoid using an element because of the way he is visually returned.

## Technical solution

Use `<dl>`, `<dt>` and `<dd>` tags to mark definition lists.

## Control method

Inspect the source code to check that every `<dl>` tag is immediately followed by `<dt>` tag.
